            Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of generative AI in
            recent years, particularly in computer vision tasks. From
            text-to-image generation to image editing, these models have shown
            remarkable capabilities. In this post, I'll share my journey
            learning about diffusion models and implementing them in my
            research.
          </p>

          <h3>What Are Diffusion Models?</h3>
          <p>
            At their core, diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to
            data and then learning to reverse this process. The forward process
            adds Gaussian noise over many timesteps, while the reverse process
            learns to denoise and reconstruct the original data. This simple yet
            powerful idea has led to state-of-the-art results in image
            generation.

          <h3>My Implementation Experience</h3>
          <p>
            When I first started implementing a diffusion model using PyTorch, I
            was surprised by how conceptually simple the training loop is. The
            main challenge was understanding the math behind the noise schedule
            and variance calculations. Here's a simplified version of the core
            training step:
          </p>

          <pre><code># Simplified diffusion training step
t = torch.randint(0, num_timesteps, (batch_size,))
noise = torch.randn_like(x)
x_noisy = sqrt_alpha[t] * x + sqrt_one_minus_alpha[t] * noise
predicted_noise = model(x_noisy, t)
loss = F.mse_loss(predicted_noise, noise)</code></pre>

          <h3>Applications in My Research</h3>
          <p>
            In my current project on tunnel lining water leakage segmentation,
            I'm exploring how diffusion models can be used for data
            augmentation. By generating synthetic training examples, we can
            potentially improve model robustness when real training data is
            limited.
          </p>

          <h3>Resources I Found Useful</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The original DDPM paper by Ho et al.</li>
            <li>Lilian Weng's excellent blog post on diffusion models</li>
            <li>Hugging Face's diffusers library documentation</li>
            <li>Various implementation tutorials on GitHub</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            Diffusion models represent an exciting frontier in generative AI.
            While they can be computationally expensive to train and sample
            from, recent work on faster sampling methods (like DDIM) is making
            them more practical. I'm excited to continue exploring their
            applications in my research and see where this technology goes next.
          </p>

          <h2>Lessons from My First Research Paper</h2>
          <div class="blog-meta">

          <p>
            Getting my first paper accepted to ICONIP 2025 was an incredible
            milestone in my academic journey. But the path to publication was
            filled with valuable lessons that I wish I had known earlier. Here's
            what I learned along the way.
          </p>

          <h3>Lesson 1: Start Writing Early</h3>
          <p>
            One of my biggest mistakes was waiting until all experiments were
            "finished" before starting to write. I learned that writing is
            actually part of the research process—it helps clarify your
            thinking, identify gaps in your experiments, and communicate your
            ideas more effectively. Now I start drafting the introduction and
            related work sections as soon as I have a clear research question.
          </p>

          <h3>Lesson 2: Collaboration Is Key</h3>
          <p>
            Working with my co-authors taught me the importance of clear
            communication and dividing responsibilities. Regular meetings,
            shared documents, and being open to feedback made the process much
            smoother. Having different perspectives also significantly improved
            the quality of our work.
          </p>

          <h3>Lesson 3: Handle Rejection Gracefully</h3>
          <p>
            Before getting accepted at ICONIP, we received reviews from another
            conference that were quite critical. Initially, it was discouraging,
            but the feedback helped us identify real weaknesses in our work. We
            revised the paper substantially based on those comments, and the
            final version was much stronger.
          </p>

          <h3>Lesson 4: The Devil Is in the Details</h3>
          <p>Small things matter more than I expected:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear, informative figure captions</li>
            <li>Consistent notation throughout the paper</li>
            <li>Properly formatted references</li>
            <li>
              Thorough proofreading (I found embarrassing typos even after
              multiple readings)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Lesson 5: Code and Reproducibility</h3>
          <p>
            Keeping clean, well-documented code from the start would have saved
            me countless hours. When it came time to respond to reviewer
            questions about implementation details, I had to dig through messy
            experiment scripts. Now I use version control properly and document
            as I go.
          </p>

          <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
          <p>
            These lessons have already proven valuable as I work on my next
            papers. Research is a learning process, and each paper teaches you
            something new about the craft of scientific writing and
            communication. I'm grateful for the mentorship I received and
            excited to keep improving.

          <h2>Why I'm Pursuing a PhD in Computer Science</h2>
          <div class="blog-meta">
            <span>📅 August 12, 2025</span>
            <span class="blog-tag">PhD</span>
            <span class="blog-tag">Career</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-content">
          <p>
            As I prepare my PhD applications, I've spent a lot of time
            reflecting on why I want to pursue graduate school. It's a
            significant commitment, and I want to make sure I'm doing it for the
            right reasons. Here are my thoughts on why research is the right
            path for me.
          </p>

          <h3>The Joy of Discovery</h3>
          <p>
            What excites me most about research is the opportunity to push the
            boundaries of what we know. Whether it's developing new algorithms,
            finding better ways to solve existing problems, or discovering
            unexpected patterns in data—there's something deeply satisfying
            about contributing new knowledge to the field.
          </p>

          <h3>Deep Dive into Problems</h3>
          <p>
            In industry, there's often pressure to move quickly and ship
            products. While I respect that urgency and have learned a lot from
            project work, I crave the opportunity to deeply understand problems.
            A PhD offers the time and environment to really dig into complex
            questions without rushing to immediate applications.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact Through Automation</h3>
          <p>
            My research interests center around automation—particularly in using
            computer vision and machine learning to automate tasks that
            currently require significant human effort. I believe this work can
            have real-world impact, whether it's in infrastructure monitoring,
            medical imaging, or other domains. A PhD will give me the skills and
            credibility to work on these impactful problems.
          </p>

          <h3>The Research Community</h3>
          <p>
            I've been inspired by the collaborative nature of academic research.
            Conferences, seminars, and open-source projects create a community
            where people freely share ideas and build on each other's work. I
            want to be part of this community and contribute to the collective
            advancement of the field.
          </p>

          <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
          <p>In choosing PhD programs, I'm looking for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Strong research groups in computer vision and machine learning
            </li>
            <li>
              Advisors whose work aligns with my interests in automation and
              practical applications
            </li>
            <li>Collaborative environments where I can learn from peers</li>
            <li>
              Opportunities to work on both theoretical understanding and
              real-world problems
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Acknowledging the Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not naive about the challenges of a PhD—the long hours, the
            inevitable setbacks, the pressure to publish. But I've experienced
            glimpses of these challenges during my undergraduate research, and
            rather than discouraging me, they've confirmed that this is work I
            find meaningful and want to pursue at a deeper level.
          </p>

          <h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I'm pursuing a PhD because I can't imagine doing
            anything else right now. The questions that keep me up at night are
            research questions. The work that makes me lose track of time is
            implementing and experimenting with new ideas. If that resonates
            with you too, maybe we'll cross paths at a conference or as
            collaborators someday.
